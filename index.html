    <p>Force diagrams are very useful and a great way to represent data. Some data which would be convenitly represented in a force diagram would be</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show relationship among data that has a common parent. Ex: a movie in the middle with related movies connected to that node. Any other related movies are subsquently connected to those nodes. So you can easily tell which movies are related in genre by if they have a line connecting them.</li>
      <li>Another case this would be useful is for showing friend circles. If you were to take a bunch of facebook data you could easily visualize friend degrees and see who has mutual friends of who and friends of friends.</li>
      <li>The last way in which a force graph may be helpful is showing relations between different types of thing. For example one node could be the name of a company and then everyone who works for that company is connected to it. This is a great and easy way to indetify workers and things that companies have in common with each other.</li>
